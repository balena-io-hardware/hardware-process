# Create a repo

To utilize the hardware process and the Prototyping Lab, your projects needs to be setup correctly. This page documents how to get started with that.

1. Create a repo using the template menu in GitHub. Select `balena-io-hardware/hardware-process-template` as seen in the screenshot below

2. In the `source/specification` folder, add contents to the `spec.json` file depending on your project. See the [next section](./writing-the-spec-json) in our docs to find out more about the fields required.
