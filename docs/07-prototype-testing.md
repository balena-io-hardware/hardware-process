# Prototype Testing

Once you have created a pull request, and it has all the information needed (spec.json, Testing.md, etc.) - the Prototyping Lab is responsible for using rapid prototyping tools to quickly build and test the design. During this process, the lab might have additional questions, or might ask for more information. This communication happens solely on the PR that has been opened by the designer.

In case, you are also playing the role of the prototyping lab, you can check the `Manufacturing Lab` inbox on Front, and then find a mail thread with your relevant pull request. When replying to the pull request via email, make sure to add one of the following to the body of the email reply.

- `Result: Success`
- `Result: Failure`

Additionally, you can attach a logfile to the email, which will be displayed on the pull request's checkrun page.
